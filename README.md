# OpenCV

This repository contains my learning journey for OpenCV. I am using this repository to track my progress, share my code, and collaborate with others.

#### What is OpenCV?

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a free and open-source library of programming functions for computer vision. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including image processing, video analysis, and machine learning.

## Installation

# Reading Image
image = cv.imread("File path")

# Displaying

cv.waitkey(0)
```
